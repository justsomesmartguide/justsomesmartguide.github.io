Track Type: Shroomer / Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Chain into item set before tree shortcut

Youâ€™ll want triple mushrooms so you can take the ending shortcut on all 3 laps. There are also a few shroomless shortcuts dotted on the track, so make sure to practice in free roam or TTs.

Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

You can still use the pole shortcut here, but most of the other shroomless shortcuts are not able to be used backwards, which makes a few extra off-road shortcuts more viable.
