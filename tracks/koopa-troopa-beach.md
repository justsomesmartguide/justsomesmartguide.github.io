Track Type: Shroomer / Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Chain into first item set on final lap

If playing this track normally, a shock isnâ€™t likely to happen, so just focus on taking the shortcuts with mushrooms. If arriving on a route, a shock is more likely to happen, so try to dodge it.

Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

Not much changes when going backwards. Keep in mind that the shock is more likely to happen since you're arriving on a route, so make sure you have dodge items. On longer routes such as from Desert Hills or Whistlestop Summit, there is an increased possibility of two shocks being in play.
