Track Type: Shroomer

Best Shock Spot: Chain into last item set

Miss the start boost to pull triple mushrooms so you can take the rail shortcut on laps 2 and 3 (shortcut cannot be taken lap 1), but otherwise treat this as a frontrunning track.

Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

You can take an off-road shortcut right after the start line but be careful you donâ€™t stick to the unwanted rail at the end. You can also take the usual rail shortcut in reverse.

Track Type: Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

Shortly after the start of section 2, there is a helicopter up for grabs to the left and a truck behind the building to the right. If you are in 1st, go for the truck because it's faster. If you're slightly further back and someone else is going for the truck, go for the helicopter, which isn't as fast as the truck, but it better than not getting anything at all.
