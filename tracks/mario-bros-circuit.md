Track Type: Shroomer

Best Shock Spot: Chain into last item set

Miss the start boost to pull triple mushrooms so you can take the rail shortcut on laps 2 and 3 (shortcut cannot be taken lap 1), but otherwise treat this as a frontrunning track.

Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

You can take an off-road shortcut right after the start line but be careful you donâ€™t stick to the unwanted rail at the end. You can also take the usual rail shortcut in reverse.
