  <span>Best Shock Spot: Target shock ending shortcut on lap 2</span>
</div>

Practice this one in time trials. The track is known for its ending shortcut, which is quite technical, but can be very consistent. There’s also a grass shortcut at the beginning that is even bigger. A lap 2 target shock at the ending shortcut can ensure that no one has mushrooms to take the beginning shortcut on lap 3.
