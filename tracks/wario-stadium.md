Track Type: Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: Chain into item set at the big jump

The track has a lot of shroomless shortcuts that you need to know how to do in order to win. After the jump, there is an off-road shortcut that you can take with a single mushroom.

Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

You can take the same off-road shortcut that you would normally take, but you can also take another one after the jump that normally isnâ€™t viable when going in the normal direction.
