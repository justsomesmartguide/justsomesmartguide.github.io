</div>
If you are starting in a middle or rear spot, miss the start boost so you can take the first shortcut without being bumped off, meanwhile you'll get a good item and pass everyone in the pack who bumped each other off. Knowing how to do both shroomless shortcuts is crucial to doing well here. After them there’s also a couple optional of mushroom shortcuts. Absolutely time trial this one.
