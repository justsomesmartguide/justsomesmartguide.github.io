Best Shock Spot: Chain into the first item set

Knowing how to do both shroomless shortcuts is crucial to doing well here. After them thereâ€™s also a couple optional of mushroom shortcuts. Absolutely time trial this one. If you pull a shock, do not target shock people taking the second shortcut. Instead chain it into the first item set on lap 3 and people immediately in front of you won't be able to take the rail shortcut, clearing the rail for you to take it.
