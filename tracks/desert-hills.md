Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: At sand dunes in middle section

The track is almost entirely shortcuts. Try to make your comeback on lap 3, but keep in mind this is when the shock tends to happen and dodging it can be quite powerful.

Track Type: Bagging

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

Exactly the same, just in reverse. The track is still almost entirely shortcuts. Take the same shortcuts and expect the shock at the same shortcuts.
