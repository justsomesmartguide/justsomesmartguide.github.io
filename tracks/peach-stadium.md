Track Type: Shroomer / Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: Beginning of final lap

It is on this track where missing the start boost to get triple mushrooms can be most effective. Get triple mushrooms and take the beginning shortcut on all 3 laps, simple as that. If arriving from DK Spaceport or Koopa Troopa Beach, the beginning shortcut is skipped, so treat this as a frontrunnning track.

Track Type: Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: Before a shortcut on the route

The shell cup version of Peach Stadium has you drive around the terminus on the lower level. Thereâ€™s not much to this track, make your comeback on the route and frontrun here.

Track Type: Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: Before a shortcut on the route

Not much changes when playing in reverse. You'll still want to make your comeback on the route and frontrun here.
