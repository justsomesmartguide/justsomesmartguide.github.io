Track Type: Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: Target shock players taking ending shroomless shortcut

The left path with the rails at the beginning is faster. At the entrance to the cave, the off-road shortcut can be done shroomless by wall riding. Very important to Time Trial this track.

Track Type: Frontrunning

Best Shock Spot: On final lap after arriving at destination \(see above\)

Grab a food item to take one of the grass shortcuts at the beginning. As you leave the city, instead of following the main path, you can go to the right and go along the train tracks, which is much faster. If you're the only one in the room who knows about this, you have a massive advantage on this route.
